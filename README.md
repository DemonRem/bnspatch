### Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only. There is no support; attempts to
contact me for support will be ignored. Using this on a live server is against the
Blade & Soul [Rules of Conduct][0] and [User Agreement][1]. I accept no
responsibility should you manage to get yourself banned while using it.

## Features
You can out the [**projects**](https://github.com/zeffy/bnspatch/projects) tab for a
road map of upcoming and already implemented features.

## Building
Everything should build as-is except for `Gaffeine.Data.XmlSerializers.dll`, which
may need a little manual configuration.

1. NC Launcher 2 must be installed. If you installed it somewhere other than
   `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\NCSOFT\NC Launcher 2` you will need to update the pre-build event
   accordingly.
2. With each new version of NC Launcher 2, `ParentAssemblyId` in `AssemblyInfo.cs` must
   be updated to match the MVID of `Gaffeine.Data.dll`, or nothing will work.
   You can find this value with dnSpy or CFF Explorer. The folder `lib\ncLauncherW`
   should also be cleared out when you do this, so that fresh publicized assemblies can
   be generated by MonoMod.
3. Updating the embedded dependencies is a little tricky. They are deflated with
   `zopfli --deflate --i1000`, but any deflater will do. Afterwards the length of
   the compressed data (32-bit unsigned) needs to be prepended to the beginning of the
   `.deflate` file.
4. If you update the `MonoMod.Utils.dll` dependency, you need to modify it so that
   its `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IgnoresAccessChecksToAttribute` type is
   `internal` instead of `public`.

## FAQ

#### Q: Does this work with [**d912pxy**][3]?
Yes it does! In fact, I highly recommend using it.

#### Q: Do I have to use all of the components for bnspatch to work?
No. Each component works individually and may be used together or separately.

#### Q: Isn't BnS Buddy more safe to use than this?
TL;DR: No.

Long version: For some reason, BnS Buddy's developer gets really insecure
when alternatives to his program show up and [really][12] [likes to][13] spread FUD
around to discourage people from using them, using scary buzzwords like "injection".

While bnspatch does make use of a DLL hijacking to do its magic, this exact method
is also used by the multi-client feature in BnS Buddy (and the XIGNCODE3 bypass as
well, previously).

In other words, bnspatch isn't any or more (or less) "inject-y" or unsafe than
BnS Buddy is. I don't expect the developer to understand any of this though, since
they literally copy-pasted both of those features from others, without giving any
credit [[dead link][14] ([mirror][15]), [link][16]].
