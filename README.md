# bnspatch [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/altu43hhdd5akowp?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/zeffy/bnspatch)
Personal project I decided to (partially) release to the public.

### Understand the following
- For educational purposes only.
- There is no support. Attempts to contact me for support will be ignored.
- No binaries are distributed, compile it yourself.
- Pull requests that I think add value to the project will be accepted.
- Using it on a live server is against the Blade & Soul [Rules of Conduct][0] and [User Agreement][1].
- I accept no responsibility should you manage to get yourself banned while using it.
