# BnS Buddy is bad, m'kay?

A lot of people will probably want to disagree with me, but here we go:

## Poor quality

1. It uses a ridiculous amount of memory for what it actually does.
2. The user interface is cluttered and confusing.
3. It has advertisements. I mean _seriously_? That's just obnoxious.
 
## Irresponsible developer
1. The developer (xEndless) frequently "forgets" to commit source code changes on GitHub, even after
   releasing application updates.
2. When their domain at GoDaddy was hijacked by someone and used to [distribute malware-infected updates][0],
   xEndless [blamed everyone but himself][1] (users for not having an anti-virus, and GoDaddy for their support mistake),
   instead of taking responsibility for his insecure programming. BnS Buddy was eventually fixed to validate update binaries,
   but the initial response to the critical situation left much to be desired.
3. [He denounces other developer's projects][2] for injecting code into the game's *launcher*, which is
   ridiculous considering his own project does essentially the same thing with Blade & Soul's actual *client* (see below).
   This is completely hypocritical, and shows he is dishonest with users about how his application worksâ€”either by malice
   or incompetence.

## Uses other people's work without giving credit
1. BnS Buddy's XIGNCODE3 bypass was copy/pasted from [VirtualPuppet/**XignCode3-bypass**][3].
2. BnS Buddy's multi-client feature is copy/pasted from [Evengard/**bnsnogg**][4] (original repository is no longer available as of 4/27/18).
   * This is especially ironic, because when Evengard [posted his project on r/bladeandsoul][5],
     the users there shouted him down and criticized him for it not being open source, 
     yet they seem to have no problem when xEndless steals his work and uses it in BnS Buddy!

## Obscures the line between "modding" and "hacking"
On the BnS Buddy forums there is a stickied post titled ["Will I get Banned For Modding? No you will not."][6], which states:

>While Modding is "technically" against the ToS, they are not going after people who mod.
>
>"But Random person XYZ got banned for modding! Its totally True! I have no proof at all that he got banned specifically for Modding, BUT ITS TOTALLY TRUE!" -
>no...no....just....no...stop it....Modding does not get you banned.
>Anyone that has ever said "I modded and got banned" was either hacking, buying/selling gold, or using a mod tool which edits the game's memory (which is considered a Hack). Most mods (including mods that I make) do not touch the game's memory in anyway, therefor they are not hacks of any kind.

Make no mistake, if you have ever used BnS Buddy's multi-client feature or XIGNCODE3 bypass then you
violated both Blade & Soul's [Rules of Conduct][7] and its [User Agreement][8]. These features go beyond simple modding
and change the way the game's code is executed, which by the post's own definition would make them hacks.
